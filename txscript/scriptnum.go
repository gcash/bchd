// scriptNum represents a numeric value used in the scripting engine with
// special handling to deal with the subtle semantics required by consensus.
//
// All numbers are stored on the data and alternate stacks encoded as little
// endian with a sign bit.  All numeric opcodes such as OP_ADD, OP_SUB,
// and OP_MUL, are only allowed to operate on n-byte integers where n=4 bytes
// until the CosmicInflation upgrade, and n=8 bytes after the upgrade.  That is,
// before CosmicInflation the range is [-2^31 + 1, 2^31 - 1], and after the
// range is [-2^63 + 1, 2^63 - 1].
//
// However the results of numeric operations may overflow. Before the
// CosmicInflation upgrade, overflows remain valid so long as they are not used
// as inputs to other numeric operations or otherwise interpreted as an integer.
// After the CosmicInflation upgrade, overflows result in an error and
// termination of script execution.
//
// For example, before the CosmicInflation upgrade:
// It is possible for OP_ADD to have 2^31 - 1 for its two operands resulting
// in 2^32 - 2, which overflows, but is still pushed to the stack as the
// result of the addition.  That value can then be used as input to OP_VERIFY
// which will succeed because the data is being interpreted as a boolean.
// However, if that same value were to be used as input to another numeric
// opcode, such as OP_SUB, it must fail.
//
// In a similar example after the CosmicInflation upgrade:
// It is possible for OP_ADD to have 2^63 - 1 for its two operands resulting
// in 2^64 - 2, which overflows, and results in an error and termination of
// script execution.
//
// This type handles the aforementioned requirements by storing all numeric
// operation results as an int64 and provides the Bytes method to get the
//serialized representation (including values that overflow).
//
// Then, whenever data is interpreted as an integer, it is converted to this
// type by using the makeScriptNum function which will return an error if the
// number is out of range or not minimally encoded depending on parameters.
// Since all numeric opcodes involve pulling data from the stack and
// interpreting it as an integer, it provides the required behavior.
